Chapter 5 Summary

Chapter 5 discusses about on how to you can make distributed workflows. How to contribute on a project and how to maintain a project.

Distributed workflow allows you to be more flexible on projects. this depends on how the develpoers collaborate on their works. Compared to a centralized workflow, developers are not treated equal. In git developers are given a chance to create their codes and considered hubs and nodes. This opens to alot of suggestions to make the project better.

You can contribute onto a project and it is on many ways. You need to check the requiremnts and needs for a project if you qualify or not. be sure to submit working files or it may break the workflow.

If you are maintaining a project, it is better to start out as a topic branch just to make some temporary work and after slowy gaining alot of developers you can start a full plegded project. Be sure to check every code for consistency to avoid broken codes. Be sure to accept work that are running and the best. Also be sure to be sustained by your developers.
